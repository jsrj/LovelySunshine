# LovelySunshine

The title is pretty self-explanatory. Click a button, enjoy some sunshine!
Just a quick exercise in animation chaining, layers, view transitions, and audio syncing using Swift. 

## Getting Started

  As this is currently not on the App Store since it is more a Proof of Concept, in order to run it and see it in action,
you will need to have XCode installed [(You can download it here.)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)

  Once installed, open the project by navigating to  "File > Open ...",
  Then make sure the build target is set to iPhone 8 by clicking the small window in the upper-right.

### Prerequisites
Mac OSX Sierra or High Sierra
XCode 9
